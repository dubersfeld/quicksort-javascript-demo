Javascript only animated demonstration of the basic Quick Sort algorithm

I present here a Javascript only animated demonstration of the Quick Sort algorithm.

It is a standalone application that can run on any browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.

The number of elements is fixed to 150.

The initial values are randomized.

The user can choose between the basic version and the version with random pivot choice.

I closely followed the approach of Cormen described in his reference textbook.

More stuff is coming soon.
