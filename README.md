# quicksort-javascript-demo
Javascript only animated demonstration of the basic Quick Sort algorithm

I present here a Javascript only animated demonstration of the Quick Sort algorithm.

It is a standalone application that can run on any browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.

The number of elements is fixed to 150.

The initial values are randomized.

I closely followed the approach of Cormen described in his reference textbook.

More stuff is coming soon.
